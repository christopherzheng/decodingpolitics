    "We could continue like this and write out the vote for each Senator. However, that would be tedious, and a computer scientist's goal is to be lazy. Instead, let's write out a function that can automate this process when given a list of the Senators' votes, assuming that all Democratic Senators vote yes for the bill along party lines, and all Republican Senators vote no. Independent Senators Angus King and Bernie Sanders caucus with the Democratic Party and will be counted as yes votes. First, however, we will need to reset the yes votes."

    "There are many attributes shared by both senators and representatives. Both senators and representatives have names, term-lengths, states they represent, committees they serve on, etc. It may appear somewhat redundant to create two different classes of objects for positions that are more similar than different—and it is. In Python and other object-oriented languages, you can establish a hierarchy that [inherits](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_inheritance.php \"Python Tutorial:Inheritance\") from its “parent.” As an example, consider a square and a rectangle. A square can be thought of as the “child” of a rectangle: it has inherited certain attributes (such as four sides), but also has unique characteristics of its own. Similarly, we could have implemented a “congressperson” object, and then had our senator and representative classes inherit the “congressperson” object to avoid implementing multiple features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can a “congressperson” exist without being a senator or representative? In our basic model, this should not ever be the case. How do we then prevent users from creating congresspeople that don’t fall into either category? There are methods of “abstraction” that can take away certain functions from users. We won’t go over them in this course as Python is not easily set up to prevent this type of error, but if you choose to take CS 61B in the future, this is an incredibly important subject when it comes to Java. For now, just keep this under consideration."
