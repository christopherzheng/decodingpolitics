""" In this project, you will randomly create tweets of 280 characters. We will define a character as any button
pressed on a keyboard that results in the cursor moving. In other words, this means all letters, all numbers, all
special characters (e.g. !#$@"), and, importantly, the space. While there is a way to do this project using
advanced computer science techniques such as natural language processing, we thought it would be fun to see if you
are able to randomly select words to form a 280-character tweet that is grammatically correct
