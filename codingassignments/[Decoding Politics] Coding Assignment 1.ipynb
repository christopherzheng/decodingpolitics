    "Welcome to your first coding assignment! The goal of this assignment is to help further familiarize you with how Python syntax works. Coding assignments are somewhat longer than labs, but they should not be significantly more difficult. Coding Assignment #1 will be due on **March 5th**. Like the lab, you will be asked to fill in code where there are ellipses (...) and write a few sentences in response to conceptual questions where it says \"YOUR ANSWER HERE\". For coding assignments, we are looking for a higher level of understanding than in the lab; however, you will have significantly more time to complete the assignment and we as facilitators will be available during office hours and through Slack.\n",
